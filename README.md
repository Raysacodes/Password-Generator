# Password-Generator
JavaScript Challenge 


For this challenge I took the provided starter code and built a JavaScript application that would prompt the user for a series of password criteria and then generate a random password based on those criteria. The newly generated password was then displayed in the page's textbox.

Clicking on the Generate Password button will cause the user to be presented with a series of prompts, including:
Size of password (between 8 and 128 characters)
* Do they want lowercase letters
* Do they want uppercase letters
* Do they want numeric characters
* Do they want special characters

The user's input is validated to ensure the size is within range and that at least one character set has been selected.

The program then generates a random password using the supplied criteria and displays the resulting new password in the page's textbox.
